Milestone one 04/10/2023:
Report: The topic of the COVID-19 period and patient experience survey (HCAHPS) has been changed due to limited survey data over time. However, I have discovered a significant dataset on California hospitals with specific attributes such as "Year completed" and "Story," which can be used to cross-reference with the HCAHPS data of California.
Topic: the goal is to evaluate the patient experience in California, taking into account factors such as facility age. 
Audience: The target audience is healthcare architects, but this may change after consulting with NAC, a healthcare architecture company, to learn more about their clients.

Milestone two 04/17/2023:
Report: I feel I am behind the schedule for analysis but here is the progress.
1- Hospital data for California was revised so now all the building types are related to the healthcare building and sections. ( canopy, energy plant, yard, corridors, etc all were excluded)
2- HCAHPS data was analyzed so it is now well-organized and categorized to the 1: California 2: Linear mean value 3: hospital names
3- I am trying to figure out how to create a list of hospital names in HCAHPS and then find similar ones in the other data sets so I can pull data out of one and create a new data frame.

Report: I feel i'm right on the track for data, story and visualization.
1- Data wrangling step is completed entirely and all the steps are thoroughly explained in the markdown part of notebook

3- I have started working on the data of some of the case studies and outliers but it is not finished yet.
